Introduction
============
Libprotoident is a library designed to perform application protocol 
identification using a very limited form of deep packet inspection, i.e. using
the first four bytes of application payload sent in each direction. The
library provides a simple API that will enable programmers to develop their own
tools that utilise application protocol information and we have also included
some tools that can be used to perform simple analysis of traffic flows.

Required Libraries
==================
libtrace
	* available from http://research.wand.net.nz/software/libtrace.php

libflowmanager
	* optional, but required to build the tools
	* available from http://research.wand.net.nz/software/libflowmanager.php

Installation
============
After having installed the required libraries, running the following series
of commands should install libprotoident

        ./configure
       	make
	make install

By default, libprotoident installs to /usr/local - this can be changed by
appending the --prefix=<new location> option to ./configure.

The libprotoident tools are built by default - this can be changed by using the
--with-tools=no option with ./configure.

Protocols Supported
===================
A full list of supported protocols can be found at 
http://wand.net.nz/trac/libprotoident/wiki/SupportedProtocols

Libprotoident also currently has rules for several "mystery" protocols. These
are patterns that commonly occur in our trace sets that we cannot tie to an
actual protocol. It would be nice to know what these protocols actually are - 
if you have any suggestions please feel free to email us at contact@wand.net.nz.

In addition, a flow can be assigned into a "category" based on the protocol
determined by libprotoident, enabling broader analysis. For example, 
BitTorrent, Gnutella and eMule all fall into the P2P category, whereas SMTP,
POP3 and IMAP are part of the Mail category.

Tools
=====
There are currently three tools included with libprotoident.

 * lpi_protoident
 
   Description:	
	
	This tool attempts to identify each individual flow within the provided
	trace. Identification only occurs when the flow has concluded or 
	expired, so it is not very effective for real-time applications. 

   Usage: 
	lpi_protoident <input trace URI>

	The input trace must be a valid libtrace URI.

   Output:
   	For each flow in the input trace, a single line is printed to stdout
	describing the flow. The line contains the following fields separated
	by spaces (in order):

	 * Application protocol (as reported by libprotoident)
	 * IP address of the first endpoint
	 * IP address of the second endpoint
	 * Port used by the first endpoint
	 * Port used by the second endpoint
	 * Transport protocol (6 = TCP, 17 = UDP)
	 * Unix timestamp when the flow began
	 * Total bytes sent from first endpoint to second endpoint
	 * Total bytes sent from second endpoint to first endpoint
	 * First four bytes of payload sent from first endpoint (in hex)
	 * First four bytes of payload sent from first endpoint (ASCII)
	 * Size of first payload-bearing packet sent from first endpoint
	 * First four bytes of payload sent from second endpoint (in hex)
	 * First four bytes of payload sent from second endpoint (ASCII)
	 * Size of first payload-bearing packet sent from second endpoint
		
 * lpi_find_unknown
 
   Description:	
	
	This tool reports all the flows in a trace which libprotoident
	was unable to identify. Identification only occurs when the flow has
	concluded or expired, so it is not very effective for real-time
	applications. 

	This is mainly intended as a tool to aid development of new protocol
	identifiers.
	
   Usage: 
	lpi_find_unknown <input trace URI>

	The input trace must be a valid libtrace URI.

   Output:
   	For each unknown flow in the input trace, a single line is printed to 
	stdout describing the flow. The line contains the following fields 
	separated by spaces (in order):

	 * IP address of the first endpoint
	 * IP address of the second endpoint
	 * Port used by the first endpoint
	 * Port used by the second endpoint
	 * Transport protocol (6 = TCP, 17 = UDP)
	 * Unix timestamp when the flow began
	 * Total bytes sent from first endpoint to second endpoint
	 * Total bytes sent from second endpoint to first endpoint
	 * First four bytes of payload sent from first endpoint (in hex)
	 * First four bytes of payload sent from first endpoint (ASCII)
	 * Size of first payload-bearing packet sent from first endpoint
	 * First four bytes of payload sent from second endpoint (in hex)
	 * First four bytes of payload sent from second endpoint (ASCII)
	 * Size of first payload-bearing packet sent from second endpoint
	
 * lpi_live
  
   Description:
   	This tool reports byte and packet counts (both inbound and outbound)
	for each identified protocol in real-time. Identification of a flow 
	occurs as soon as possible, so that the statistics reported are as
	up-to-date as possible.

   Usage:
   	lpi_live <options> <input URI>

	The input URI must be a valid libtrace URI.

   Options:
        -f <filterstring> : Specifies a BPF filter to be applied to the input.
	-R : ignore traffic to or from RFC1918 private addresses.
	-i <secs>: Specifies the reporting interval (in seconds).

   Output:
      	lpi_live creates four output files called packets_in, packets_out, 
	bytes_in and bytes_out. Each line in those files describes the amount
	of traffic observed for each supported protocol during the reporting
	interval beginning from the timestamp given as the first field of the
	line.

	The first line in each file is a header which describes the mapping of
	protocols to columns in the output file.

	The bytes_in and bytes_out files report the traffic in kilobits per
	seconds. The packets_in and packets_out files simply contain raw
	packet counts.
	
API
===

If you want to develop your own tools based on libprotoident, you'll need to
use the libprotoident API. The API is very simple and the best way to learn it 
is to examine how the existing tools work. The source for the tools is
located in the tools/ directory.

The tools use libflowmanager to do the flow tracking, using functions beginning
with 'lfm_'. You will probably want to incorporate this into your own tool.
Usage of libprotoident itself is through functions beginning with 'lpi_'.

The libprotoident API functions themselves are documented in 
lib/libprotoident.h if you need further guidance.

Further documentation of the API can also be found at 
http://wand.net.nz/trac/libprotoident/wiki/DeveloperDocs
